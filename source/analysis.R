## Q1: What is the percentage of black individuals in jail compared to total jail population in the year 2018?
#----------------------#

# Total number of black people in jail 
black_jail_total <- prison %>%

    # remove unknowns

## Q2:What year has the highest black population in jail?
#---------------------------#
